# Bootcamp 2020 Project 4A - Red Queenâ€™s Race Project:

Review the code and demo (https://codepen.io/rachelnabors/pen/PNGGaV) and improve and build your own Red Queens Race Animation with React Hooks.

## Note the following:

When Alice drinks from the bottle, she grows smaller.
Because small children tire out easily, unlike automaton chess pieces, Alice is constantly slowing down.
But urging them on by clicking or tapping causes them to speed up.
The background elements also have playback rates that are impacted when you click or tap.

Your code should be hosted in a GitHub Repo from the beginning with GitHub CI/CD Actions and hosted on Surge.

## Notes:
Once we start Freelancing and Working Remotely we will use this app as our portfolio to show to our clients our technical capabilities.
Those developers who will build the best app will be immediately selected to be part of our teaching and software development team.
