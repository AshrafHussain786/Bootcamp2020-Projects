Bootcamp 2020 Project 5 - Animated React Website Project:

“Our eyes are hardwired to notice movement. Historically, it’s helped to keep us alive. And, in 2020, web designers are capitalizing on this default human setting. Animated illustrations are one of the newest trends being used to direct viewer attention within web designs. You’ll see these petite animations on sites all over the web. Some animated illustrations are merely still graphics that jiggle, while other illustrated animations are more thoughtful and complex. When used to their fullest capacity, animated illustrations can tell stories, explain concepts, or help viewers navigate a website.” The 8 Biggest Web Design Trends of 2020
